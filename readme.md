# Small Projects

This repo is a collection of projects that I've created from the tutorials I've completed from different classes.

I've extended, built and expanded the course projects to build larger and better projects. In some cases I've combined the projects into a larger project. I will go back over earlier projects to improve on them. 

I will mention the tutorials and any sites or services that I used to create these mini-projects.

These are not themselves a tutorial anymore then class notes are a replacement for the text book or lectures. But I do try to add comments.

## Installing

I'm using no Frameworks or libraries that need to be installed or setup. 

## Github Pages

This project is located on [Github pages](https://russeby.github.io/SmallProjects)

## Course Work

Most of the projects were inspired by [JavaScript 50+ projects and applications Monster JavaScript](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-course-projects/) course on Udemy.

Some projects were created during assignments on Codecademy.
