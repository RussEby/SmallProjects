# Small Projects

This repo is a collection of projects that I've created from the tutorials I've completed from different classes.

These aren't the exact projects. I've extended, built and expanded the projects to build larger and better projects. In some cases I've combined the projects into a larger project.

I will mention the tutorial that inspired the original work.

These are not themselves a tutorial anymore then class notes are a replacement for the text book or lectures. But I do try to add comments.
